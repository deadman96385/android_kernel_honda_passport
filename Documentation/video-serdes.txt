Video serializer and de serializer
==================================

Video serializers and de serializers are the devices which are used to
interface parallel port video imaging or display devices using serial
medium.

Video serializer are used at the transmit side to convert the parallel data
and the control signals to serial data and send it at high frequency
using fewer cables.
Video de serializer are used at the receive side to convert the serial data
into parallel port video and recreate the same control signals.

Typical video serializer/de serializer (serdes) uses data lines as well as
pixel clock, hsync, vsync, etc.

The video serdes devices are controlled via I2C interface and they are always
used in pairs. One end is connected to the video peripheral and other is
connected to the CPU/ SoC. In this way, only one of the device is actually
connected to the I2C bus while other device is controllable remotely.

In case of camera, serializer and camera are remotely connected to the
system and are controllable via deserializer.
First, the deserializer needs to be configured before accessing the
serialzer or the camera.

In case of display, de serializer and display are remotely connected to the
system and are controllable via serializer.
First, the serializer needs to be configured before accessing the
deserializer of the display.

When serdes devices are to be controlled remotely, the device which is
connected to the system registers it's counterpart as an alias.
So that all the accesses done to the alias are reproduced at the remote end.


Linux kernel has driver support for following video devices:
===========================================================

"drivers/video/serdes/fpd3_serdes.c" supports video (de)serializers.
See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/video/fpd3-serdes.txt
for more information on the devices supported and the device tree bindings
